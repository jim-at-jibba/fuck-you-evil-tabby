> This all came about after an evil, bully of a tabby cat arrived in our neighbourhood. It was terrorising my cats causing
> stress and injury and I needed to be able to deter it without upsetting my own cats. I decided to completely over engineer
> it and to train a machine learning model will detect unknown cats and make them go away. The method of detering them is still
> up for debate but will like involve a high pitched noise or jet of air.
